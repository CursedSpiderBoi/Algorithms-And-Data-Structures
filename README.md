| [Doubly Link List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list) | can move both forward and backward | A train connected with its compartments( nodes ) and if you move through one compartment the previous compartment door stays open
|[Circular Link List](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/circular-linked-list/) | like a linked list but the head and tail are connected | All the Players are kept in a Circular Linked List and the pointer keeps on moving forward as a player's chance ends.
